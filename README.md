## React.Component
1. Describe mounting component lifecycle
  - `render()` - required method
    - examines this.props and this.state and returns a single react element
    - return null or false to render nothing
    - *will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false*
    - should be pure
  - Mounting
    - `constructor()`
      - called before mounting
      - *if sublclassing, call super(props) first!*
      - initializes state
    - `componentWillMount()` - called immediately before mounting, before render
      - setting state synchronously will not trigger a re-render
      - *only lifecycle hook called on server rendering*
    - `render()`
    - `componentDidMount()` - invoked immediately after component has mounted
      - init that requires DOM nodes goes here
      - instantiating network requests goes here
      - setting state will trigger re-render
  - Updating
    - `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)` - before mounted components receives new props
      - compare this.props to nextProps and use this.setState() to handle accordingly
      - *React may call this when props have not changed*
      - only called if some component props may update
      - calling this.setState() generally doesn't trigger this
    - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` - let React know if component's output is affected by current change in state or props
      - defaults to re-render on every state change
      - not called on initial render or forceUpdate()
      - React.PureComponent implements a shallow prop/state comparison
    - `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` - invoked immediately before rendering when new props or state are received
      - cannot call this.setState() here, use componentWillReceiveProps() instead
      - *will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false*
    - `render()`
    - `componentDidUpdate`(prevProps, prevState) - invoked immediately after updating, not called on initial render
      - operate on DOM here when component has updated
      - 'good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed)'
      - *will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false*
  - Unmounting
    - `componentWillUnmount()` - invoked before component is unmounted and destroyed
      - cleanup; invalidating timers, cancelling network requests, cleaning DOM elements that were created
  - `setState(updater, [callback])` - enqueues changes to component state and triggers re-render unless shouldComponentUpdate returns false
    - *React does not guarantee that state changes are applied immediately*
      - reading state immediately after call is a pitfall, use componentDidUpdate() or the setState callback instead
    - `updater = (prevState, props) => stateChange`
      - prevState is ref to previous state; do not mutate, build a new object instead
    - passing an object performs shallow merge
  - `forceUpdate()` - short circuits `shouldComponentUpdate()` and calls render() directly
    - still only updates DOM if markup changes
    - *try and avoid using this*
  - defaultProps() - sets defaultProps, but does not overwrite null
